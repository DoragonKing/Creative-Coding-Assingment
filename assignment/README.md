# Creative Coding Assingment

The code creates a canvas of which the user can interact with it, painting something they want.
They can scroll the mouse wheel to change the size of the circles drawn. To change the colour
simply press any key on the keyboard and it will change to the next colour in the array.
Clicking draws the circle, when you release the mouse it will stop drawing. At first the Rainbow used
the random function, I changed it to the noise function which gave a nicer and smoother effect
